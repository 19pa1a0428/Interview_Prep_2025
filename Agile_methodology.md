### 🛠️ How It Works  
📅 **Iterations/Sprints**: 1-4 week cycles delivering shippable features  
🔄 **Feedback-Driven**: Continuous stakeholder input after each sprint  
🤝 **Daily Standups**: 15-minute syncs to discuss progress/blockers  
📊 **Retrospectives**: End-of-sprint reviews to improve processes  

### ⚡ Key Benefits  
✅ **Flexibility**: Adapt to changing requirements mid-project  
💡 **Early Delivery**: Ship MVP fast and iterate  
🔍 **Quality Focus**: Testing integrated into every sprint  
👥 **Team Empowerment**: Self-organizing cross-functional teams  

### 📈 Typical Workflow  
1. **Sprint Planning**: Prioritize backlog tasks  
2. **Development**: Code + test in parallel  
3. **Daily Scrums**: Sync on blockers  
4. **Sprint Review**: Demo features to stakeholders  
5. **Retrospective**: Optimize next sprint  

### 🐞 Challenges  
⚠️ **Cultural Shift**: Requires buy-in from leadership/teams  
⚠️ **Scope Creep**: Need strict backlog prioritization  
⚠️ **Documentation**: Risk of under-documenting complex systems  

### 🛠️ Popular Frameworks  
- **Scrum** (Roles: Product Owner/Scrum Master/Dev Team)  
- **Kanban** (Visual workflow with WIP limits)  
- **XP** (Extreme Programming: Pair programming, CI/CD)
